# Intention
This blog post will show the development process of a percussive real time synth.

# Prior research
After telling my supervisors I wanted to build a percussive [NIME](https://www.wordnik.com/words/nime/),
one of them suggested I looked at the article [Physically Informed Sonic Modeling (PhISM): Synthesis of Percussive Sounds](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3681012#metadata_info_tab_contents) by Perry Cook from 1997.

One-pager containing initial first sketch of NIME and answers to some guiding quetions can be seen in [this PDF document](/documents/NIME_miniproject_RasmusNuko.pdf).
