## Background
For my 'New Interfaces of Musical Expression' (NIME) course we have to do a mini project where we build an instrument.
We had to hand in a one-pager containing our initial first sketch and answers to some guiding quetions. My one-pager can be seen in [this PDF document](/documents/NIME_miniproject_RasmusNuko.pdf).
One of my supervisors had already build something similar before, and suggested I looked at the article [Physically Informed Sonic Modeling (PhISM): Synthesis of Percussive Sounds](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3681012#metadata_info_tab_contents) by Perry Cook from 1997.

## Questions and Goals
In my first semester, I have three courses: NIME, 'Sound Processing' and 'Music Perception and Cognition'.
For each course we have to do a mini project, and I will incorporate this NIME in all three.

The mini project in: 
+ Sound Processing will be based around the implementation and theoretical material behind the synth engine.
+ NIME is going to be the actual building, deciding on hardware components, mapping sensor data to the software.
+ Music Perc.&Cogn. had some recommendations for projects, and there was one on how people percieve the timing og notes with short/long attacks. The idea will be to test how people try to play my NIME in time with varrying attack times.
