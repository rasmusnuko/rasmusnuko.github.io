My name is Rasmus Nuko JÃ¸rgensen and I'm based in Denmark.
I graduated a B.Sc. in Computer Science from The University of Southern Denmark Odense in 2022.
I'm currently persuing a Masters degree in Sound and Music Computing at Aalborg University in Copenhagen (2022-2024).

I went with Sound and Music Computing, as it combines two of my interests: Sound and Computing.
My musical experience consists of fooling around in Ableton, and not of any traditional training / music education.
Having had music production as a hobby for years, I've gained an understanding of audio effects and synthesis.
The time has come for me to combine sound and computing, to understand audio effects / synthesis on a more theoretical level.
